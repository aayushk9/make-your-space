# MYS: Make your space

Make your space is a modern full stack web application designed to help couples stay organized and connected. It provides a **shared space** where partners can manage their relationship through a **shared calendar, task manager, countdown timer and surprise scheduling features**. 

Our goal is to make relationship management fun and intuitive by offering a private, dedicated space for couples to stay in sync.

## Why MYS?

✅ **Shared Space for Couples** – Permanent couple code for easy access, expiring only when one partner deletes it.  
📅 **Shared Calendar** – Manage important dates, anniversaries and plans together.  
📌 **Task Manager** – Split bills and responsibilities.  
⏳ **Countdown Timer** – Track the next meetup or vacation and get a countdown for it.
